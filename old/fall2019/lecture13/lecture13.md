# Lecture 13

## General Outline of Machine Learning
- Loading Data
  - Load toy data included in sklearn
  - Download published/annotated data from online
  - Generate data with specific statistics to learn how algorithms work
- Preprocessing Data
  - Make data zero mean
  - Make data unit variance
  - Fix range of values
  - Deal with missing values
  - Map text labels to integer labels (if applicable)
- Dimensionality Reduction of data
  - If you use too many features and do not have enough samples, you could over fit.
  - So you have to choose the most discriminating few features
- Applying algorithms
  - Labeled Data - Supervised 
  - Non-labeled Data - Unsupervised 
- Evaluation 
  - Receiver Operator Curve
    - Sensitivity
    - Specificity
  - Imbalanced Data
    - Example: 95 % one class, 5% another class
