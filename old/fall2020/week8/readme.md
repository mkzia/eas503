# Week 8
## Week 8 Topics
- Object-oriented programming
- Generators/Iterators


### Object Oriented Programming
- oop_example1.py
- oop_example2.py
- Payroll system example 

#### Payroll system using polymorphism
- Employee -- Abstract
    - variables (properties)
    - lastname
    - firstname
    - social_security_number
    - functions (methods)
    - __repr__ -- 
    - earnings() -- 
- SalariedEmployee -- inherits from Employee
- CommissionEmployee -- inherits from Employee
- HourlyEmployee -- inherits from Employee
- BasePlusCommissionEmployee -- inherits from CommissionEmployee

- Demonstrate polymorphism
- operator overloading 

#### Operator overloading
- We know how to create objects. Now we will learn how to define what +, -, or lte means for an object
- add
- gt
- lt
- eq
- iterators https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/iterator
  - iter()
  - next()
  - StopIteration
- generators https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/generator

### Self
- self.py
- class variable vs instance variable (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-class-and-instance-variables-in-python-3)
- staticmethods vs class methods
- self is a reference to the current instance
